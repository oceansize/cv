Currently I work at Carwow — a car-comparison application which is designed to take the pain out of buying a new car. Here I am employed as a Front End Developer, where we work using Ruby on Rails and elm to bring our automotive experience to the masses.

It's rewarding to be working on a product that disrupts a process so many find painful, while working for a business who genuinely want to improve the experience of both the people buying cars, and the people selling them.

Before Carwow, I started my tech career at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) — [You can read about that role here.](https://github.com/oceansize/cv/blob/9c4cbbf39eedcf03b3a5f3ed3266cab00ceb5fa7/README.md)

###### Feedback from Carwow:

"Roi is curious, passionate, great for team culture and has great product brain ... He challenges, contributes, leads and is very inclusive in team discussions ... Roi is quick to call me out on things and has the ability to truly see the broader picture. He raises things in retrospectives that few people would have considered. He also listens well and builds on ideas made by others.

Roi also is very keen to learn and to improve his skill set which is great. He doesn’t insist on front-end cards and he asks questions when he doesn’t understand ... he seems to be increasing his technical ability very quickly and it is great to see him grow in that regard. Roi wants what is best for the team which is a great trait." ~ Team Project manager
