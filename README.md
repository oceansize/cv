# Roi Driscoll — CV

Hi, I'm Roi. I live in London and I'm a software developer. I like making things that work well and are built to last — if they can make people's lives better, then I'm happy.

Right now, I'm working at [Tempo](https://heytempo.com/) — a platform built to revolutionize the recruitment industry by employing a proprietary matching algorithm to match candidates with companies. I'm employed as a full stack developer, and my team focuses on using NodeJS on the back end, with React on the client side.

###### Feedback from Carwow:

"Roi is curious, passionate, great for team culture and has great product brain ... He challenges, contributes, leads and is very inclusive in team discussions ... Roi is quick to call me out on things and has the ability to truly see the broader picture. He raises things in retrospectives that few people would have considered. He also listens well and builds on ideas made by others.

Roi also is very keen to learn and to improve his skill set which is great. He doesn’t insist on front end cards and he asks questions when he doesn’t understand ... he seems to be increasing his technical ability very quickly and it is great to see him grow in that regard. Roi wants what is best for the team which is a great trait." ~ Team Project manager
