I work at Makers Academy - a crazy place where even crazier people show up with the dream of becoming a Developer, and leave 12 weeks later with a love of code and the ability to figure out how to build some pretty great stuff.

Once upon a time, I was one of those people. Tired of my life as a graphic designer, a new challenged beckoned, and coding was to be my new medium. During the course I figured that a good way to learn faster was to start teaching others, so I did - every day before classes. The instructors saw this, and took notice.

Two years later and I find myself working as coach at Makers, using sneaky academic tricks like Spiral Learning, the Socratic Method, and waving diagrams of Bloom's Taxonomy in front of (soon-to-be-former) accountants, chefs, dancers and poker players all eager to unlock the secrets of Ruby and JavaScript, hoping to embark on new careers and be like Neo (or Trinity) from the Matrix.

While I cannot vouch for their bullet-dodging ability, I can confirm that they go out and get Dev jobs. And I'm damn proud of both them, and my involvement in their success.

## Skills  

#### Craft

My Dad used to call it "The love of the work" when explaining why it was important to sand down wood until it felt like glass. He had a seal on the side of his truck announcing he belonged to the "Guild of Master Craftsmen", and I liked the idea of being proud of the things you make. I care very much the things I make are useful and robust enough to remain that way for as long as they have a purpose.

#### Creativity

From crayons to code, I love seeing something come to life. I'm good at it too - at Makers Academy we regularly need to find new ways to explain concepts (because everyone learns differently), or generate ideas for projects (90+ ideas for each cohort), curriculum (constantly evolving thanks to our unquenchable desire for feedback) and presentations. I grew up playing in bands, writing music and improvising and ended up having a good long career as a graphic designer. Being able to make something out of nothing is probably my superpower.

#### Curiosity

Some people _just have to know._ I'm one of those. If I won the lottery, I would blow every penny of it spending time with people who knew their craft, and were willing to demonstrate it to me. I love learning more than anything else in this world and often that means taking things apart and putting them back together. If a few electronic items have to go down in the name of discovery, I'm ok with that. But more than this, I love seeing curiosity in others, and shaping a question into a _better question_ is one of the finest abilities programming (and coaching) has given me.

#### Collaboration

When Christopher McCandless wrote "Happiness [sic] only real when shared" in the margin of his copy of Doctor Zhivago, he probably wasn't talking about software development. However, it's a universal idea and something I subscribe to. Working with others helps me see through new eyes, reach shelves that were too awkward to get to, challenge preconceptions and understand all things to a finer degree.

I'm a strong communicator, and thrive in environments where open and honest dialogue is encouraged. Makers Academy is a ["Teal" organisation](https://blog.makersacademy.com/the-evolution-of-management-what-we-mean-when-we-say-teal-8b134a17ba72#.9n63j7dwl) which means that to navigate an environment with no managers, we have to transparently and honestly tell others how they are doing, and ask them to help us identify where we could be performing well, and where we need work. It's an incredibly difficult environment for most people, but those who remain tend to be some of the more driven, intelligent and passionate people I have ever worked with.
